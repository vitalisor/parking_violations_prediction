## Description

This project aims to predict the invalid parking ratio (invalid_ratio) for specific geographic zones and timeframes. 
The problem is to identify patterns in illegal parking based on spatio-temporal features such as location (latitude/longitude), 
traffic volume (total_count), and time (hour, day, month).

### Task Type

Regression (Tabular Data)
