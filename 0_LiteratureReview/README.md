  - **Objective**:The objective was to propose a data-driven framework using NYC open data (parking tickets, POIs, human mobility) to understand and predict the spatiotemporal legality of on-street parking, while also examining the impact of different spatial scales on model performance.

  - **Methods**:The study aggregated multi-source data into four spatial units (point, street, census tract, and grid) and applied various machine learning models—including Random Forest, SVM, and DNN—as both a regression problem (predicting ticket counts) and a binary classification problem (legal vs. risky).
  - **Outcomes**:The results showed that the Random Forest model performed best across all spatial scales for both regression and classification , that finer spatial resolutions generally produced less error , and that POIs like retail and food services were positively associated with parking violations.
